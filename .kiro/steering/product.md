# Product Overview

## Student Attendance System

A comprehensive web-based attendance management system designed for educational institutions. The system enables teachers to:

- Manage student records and class rosters
- Track attendance using QR code scanning
- Handle excuse requests with file uploads
- Generate attendance reports and analytics
- Monitor late arrivals and absences
- Auto-expire pending excuse requests after 7 days
